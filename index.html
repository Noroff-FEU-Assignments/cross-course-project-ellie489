    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">It is important to use https so the data on your website is encrypted. You should also hide passwords and only show necessary personal information. (Example: only last 4 digits in credit card). You could potentially use an authorization key or send a secret code to the user. Make sure you connect to a trusted network as well as a safe host for your website. Another way to secure your website would be to sanitize the data. 
      To maintain the security of your website, it is good to use scanning tools, penetration testing or even offer a bug bounty. </p>
